                    "I don't really know what to say about this program other than it was PERFECT! Kaitlyn has so much drama, <br />
                    creativity and personality inside of her and this was finally a way of channeling it to others! She enjoyed <br />
                    not only how to memorize lines and act but also the behind the scenes components such as stage makeup and <br />
                    special effects. This was a fun, informative, and extremely useful class for her!" <br />

                    "When the flyer came home asking if you would describe your child as dramatic, I knew we had to sign up! She <br />
                    came home from every class excited to tell me what she had learned. I was so impressed by the class and the <br />
                    confidence it helped her build. And at the final performance, she felt like a star!" <br />

                    "Kids Play is an excellent introduction to stage theatre with a creative and fun approach for children of all <br />
                    ages. My daughter especially loved role playing with her friends and the final performance. Ms. Amanda does a <br />
                    wonderful job of encouraging the imagination of children while teaching them technique. We are looking forward <br />
                    to another session!" <br />

                    performances! Both my children really enjoy it!" <br />

                    always looked forward to “drama day”.  She learned a lot and the last show at the end was adorable. The kids did a great job!!" <br />
